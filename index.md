**wiki about me**

Just a dude who's all about coding, designing systems, and being a dog dad. If I had to sum it up, I'd say I'm super passionate and pretty creative.

If my code editor isn't active, you'll find me with my **Spotify** playlist on loop, delving into entertaining **YouTube** videos, walking my dogs 🐾, and, without fail, watching **Formula 1** during race weekends.

currently helping build some awesome **Cloud Security** products at a startup in Munich, Germany. Wanna know more? Hit me up on LinkedIn or shoot me an email!

peace out ✌🏼
